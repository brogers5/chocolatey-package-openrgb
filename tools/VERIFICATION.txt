VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.
 
The packaged ZIP archives are available for independent download via the Releases page on OpenRGB's
website. The Releases page is at the following URL:
https://openrgb.org/releases.html

For convenience, these are direct URLs to the relevant archives:
https://openrgb.org/releases/release_0.9/OpenRGB_0.9_Windows_32_b5f46e3.zip
https://openrgb.org/releases/release_0.9/OpenRGB_0.9_Windows_64_b5f46e3.zip

The following PowerShell pipeline will calculate and print a SHA256 hash for each archive:

    Get-FileHash -Path @('OpenRGB_0.9_Windows_32_b5f46e3.zip', 'OpenRGB_0.9_Windows_64_b5f46e3.zip') -Algorithm SHA256 | Select-Object -Property Path, Hash

This pipeline should be executed against both independently downloaded archives, as well as the
copies distributed with the package. Both copies of each archive should have identical hash values.
A matching hash value should confirm that no corruption or tampering has occurred during this package's
generation process.

For reference, the following SHA256 hashes were calculated during the package's automated creation:
